#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
1. | The student will take elements for input in a <br> queue. | Simulator will store the values <br> of the elements| <div align="justify"> Student will be able to make <br> a queue
2. | The student will click the insertion button. | Simulator will perform the  <br> insertion operation | <div align="justify"> Student will learn how <br> insertion is carried out in a <br> queue
3. | The student will click the deletion button.  | Simulator will perform the <br> deletion operation | <div align="justify"> Student will acquire <br> knowledge about the  <br> deletion operation in a <br> queue.
