#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr. No |	What Students will do?| What Simulator will do?| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--------------------------------|-------------
1.|  Student will click on start button | Simulator will show the start simulator button | To start the simulator
2.|Student will fill in blanks for right answer with respect to statement | Simulator will show the statements with empty boxes to fill in the blanks. If the ans is correct, simulator will take to next page, if not, a message saying retry will appear. If the answer is again wrong, the simulator will prompt the hint saying read the theory and again take the simulator.| To remember Norton's Theorem, KCL and KVL.
3.| Student will drag and drop the images against the circuit components given .|Simulator will show the name of circuit component along with random images of circuit components.|To identify various electrical circuit components.
4.| Student will input the values for DC supply(V<sub>1</sub>), resistors(R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>) and load resistor R<sub>1</sub>.|Simulator will show complex circuit with numerical input boxes.|Initiate the interaction with the experimental set-up.
5.| Student will calculate the value of R<sub>N</sub> and I<sub>N</sub> and input them in the boxes given along with R<sub>1</sub>. | Simulator will show calculate button if any of the values are wrong, hints will appear as a prompt in the form of formula for R<sub>N</sub> and I<sub>N</sub>. If R<sub>1</sub> value is wrong ,the user will be given R<sub>L</sub> value as a hint.Wrong values are highlighted in red and right values will be highlighted in green(box).|To get the required values of R<sub>N</sub>, I<sub>N</sub> and R<sub>L</sub>.
