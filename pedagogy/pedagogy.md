#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr. No |	What Students will do?| What Simulator will do?| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--------------------------------|-------------
1.|  Student will click on start button | Simulator will show a task where student will complete the statement of Norton's Theorem by clicking on drop-down tab shown on simulator. | To start the simulator.
2.| Student will on click on drop down tab. | Simulator will show various options to fill that blank . If the answer is correct, simulator will show a prompt saying your statement is right and at bottom it will show an 'OK' botton. If answer is incorrect a message saying retry will appear. If the answer is again wrong, the simulator will prompt the hint saying read the theory and again take the assessment test.| To remember Norton's Theorem.
3.| Student will click on 'OK' button. | Simulator will show second task where nodes and Circuit Component Block will appear seperetaly and an instruction will appear saying click on circuit component to connect them. | To connect component to make circuit.
4.| Student will click  on components to make connections as directed by simulator. |Simulator will show the circuit  with its all components having name tag and a box for input values.|To have input values of each components.
5.| Student will input the values for DC supply(V<sub>1</sub>), resistors(R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>) and load resistor R<sub>L</sub>.|Simulator will show a complex circuit and 'OK' button.|To initiate the calculation of load current.
6.| Student will click on 'OK' button. |Simulator will show further instruction along with a task where student have  to select  correct option. |To help the user to recall the formula to calculate load current.
7.| Student will select  the answer |simulator will show further instruction saying "To calculate R<sub>N</sub> first open the load resistance by clicking on undo button".| To help user to understand meaning of opening the circuit.  
8.| Student will click on undo button. | Simulator will disconnect the load resistance and further show an instruction saying now short the source circuit node XY.| To open the load terminal.
9.| Student will short the XY node . If student directly shorts the XY node by using wire without removing voltage source it will show fire by saying "if we directly connect wire ,whole current will  flow through wire and it would caught fire .So for shorting first remove the voltage then connect the wire for shorting correctly". and if he shorts XY node properly, simulator will show a button 'Calculate R<sub>N</sub>'. |To help user to understand the correct wy of shorting. 
10.| Student will click on 'Calculate R<sub>N</sub>'. |Simulator will show a question on the basis of finding euivalent resistance.|To check the knowledge of user about finding equivalent resistance. 
11.| Student will answer the question. | If answer is correct it will show the value of R<sub>N</sub> along with further instruction to calculate I<sub>N</sub> whith message that "short the load resistance to find load current",and if answer is wrong simulator will show correct way to calculate it by giving a hint.| To help user to know how to calculate equivalent resistance.
12.|
5.| Student will calculate the value of R<sub>N</sub> and I<sub>N</sub> and input them in the boxes given along with R<sub>1</sub>. | Simulator will show calculate button if any of the values are wrong, hints will appear as a prompt in the form of formula for R<sub>N</sub> and I<sub>N</sub>. If R<sub>1</sub> value is wrong ,the user will be given R<sub>L</sub> value as a hint.Wrong values are highlighted in red and right values will be highlighted in green(box).|To get the required values of R<sub>N</sub>, I<sub>N</sub> and R<sub>L</sub>. 
6.| Student will construct Norton's equivalent circuit and click submit button. |Simulator will show the Norton's equivalent circuit with numerical input box. | To construct Norton's equivalent circuit 
7.|Student will click on calculate I<sub>L</sub> button. | simulator will give the value of load current(I<sub>L</sub>).| To calculate load current (I<sub>L</sub>).
