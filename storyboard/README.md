## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1:To Verify Norton's Theorem in DC Circuit.

### 1. Story Outline:

 The basic idea of this experiment is to solve the value of load current in complex electric circuit
     using Norton's Theorem. This experiment will consists of DC supply, resistor, ammeter and voltmeter.
	 This experiment will also give an idea about Norton's equivalent resistance (Rn) and Norton's equivalent 
	 current (In). Based on the information of Rn and In, the value of  load current (Il) will be calculated 
		using Norton's equivalent circuit.
### 2. Story:
In electrical engineering , the most important parameter is to calculate the value of electric current
     in the load. It is easy to calculate current in simple electric circuit by using KVL and KCL. However, it is very 
	 difficult to calculate current in complex electric circuit using KVL/KCL. The         , suitable theorem
	 or technique is required to address this issue. Norton's theorem is one of the best suitable option to 
	 calculate  current in complex electric current.Norton's Theorem for states that " Any active linear bilateral complex network can be converted into a
     single current source equivalent in which Norton's  equivalent current (In) is connected in parallel 
	 with parallel combination of Norton's equivalent resistance (Rn) and load resistance (Rl)."The Norton's equivalent circuit  of any complex circuit can be converted  into single current source 
     equivalent as shown in figure
